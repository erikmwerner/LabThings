# Lab Things Ui
The Ui classes provide support for drawing a user interface to a graphics display. The Ui class inherits from LT_Device, and can be managed by a device manger. The Ui manages one or more Screens which each manager a collection of GraphicsItems. Features include:

* A customizable scrolling menu system
* Text, number, and progress bar screens
* Graphs (bar, line, scatter)
*

This libray depends on the [U8G2] (https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) library to provice driver support for a large range of graphics displays.
